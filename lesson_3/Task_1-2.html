	<div id="text" style="width:500px;text-align:justify;">One day a man was walking along the street. He carried an old bag in his hands. He was wondering why people who had so much money were never satisfied and always wanted more. 'As to me,' he said, 'if I had enough to eat, I shouldn't ask for anything else.' Just at this moment Fortune came down the street. She heard the man and stopped. 'Listen,' she said, 'I want to help you. Hold your bag, and I shall pour diamonds into it. But every diamond which falls on the ground will become dust. Do you understand?'  'Oh, yes, I understand,' said the man. He quickly opened his bag and stream of diamonds was poured into it. The bag began to grow heavy. 'Is that enough?' asked Fortune. 'Not yet.' The man's hand's began to tremble. 'You are the richest man in the world now.' Said Fortune. 'Just a few more, and a few more,' said the man. Another diamond was added and the bag slipped. All the diamonds fell on the ground and became dust. Fortune disappeared, leaving the man in the street.
